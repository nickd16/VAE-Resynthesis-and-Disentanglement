# VAE-Resynthesis-and-Disentanglement
Implementation of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and exploration of its latent space. This repository was to practice a simple model that implements the VAE algorithm/model. This is in preparation for eventually building diffusion models from scratch. 
- Will soon implement Resynthesis and Disentanglement for VAE's
